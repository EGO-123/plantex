## Run the game

### Windows binaries

Precompiled binaries for Windows x64 can be downloaded on the [releases page](https://github.com/OsnaCS/plantex/releases). Latest build: [v0.1.0](https://github.com/OsnaCS/plantex/releases/download/v0.1.0/plantex-win.zip).

### Compile the game

For all other platforms you have to compile the game yourself. Clone this repository (or download it as ZIP file) and execute:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

After the compilation has finished, you can run the game by either executing the binary in `./target/release/` or executing:

```bash
$ cargo run --release --bin plantex
```

Development will probably stop after the practical has ended. If there is enough interest in the game idea, the game is probably rewritten from scratch (the code in this repository often is far from optimal). Don't hesitate to make suggestions or file PRs, though! Just keep in mind the status of this project...
